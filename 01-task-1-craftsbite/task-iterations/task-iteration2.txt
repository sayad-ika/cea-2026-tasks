## Iteration 2 — Team/Department Views + Special Days
### Feature requests
1. **Team-based visibility**
   - Employees can see which team they belong to.
   - Team Leads can view participation for their own team for the day.
   - Admin/Logistics can view participation across all teams.

2. **Bulk and exception handling**
   - Team Leads/Admin can apply bulk actions for their scope (e.g., mark a group as opted out due to offsite/event).

3. **Special day controls**
   - Admin/Logistics can mark a day as one of:
     - Office Closed
     - Government Holiday
     - Special Celebration Day (with a note)
   - The system adjusts meal availability based on the day type (e.g., office closed disables meals).

4. **Improved headcount reporting**
   - Headcount totals available by:
     - Meal type
     - Team
     - Overall total
     - Office vs WFH split

5. **Live updates (no refresh)**
   - When an employee updates meal participation, the visible headcount totals update immediately without reloading the page.

6. **Daily announcement draft**
   - Logistics/Admin can generate a copy/paste-friendly message for a selected date.
   - The message includes meal-wise totals and highlights special-day notes (holiday/office closed/celebration).

7. **Work location for a date**
   - Employees can set their work location for a selected date: Office / WFH.
   - Team Leads / Admin can correct missing work-location entries when needed.

8. **Company-wide WFH period**
   - Admin/Logistics can declare a date range as “WFH for everyone”.
   - During the declared period, the system treats employees as WFH by default for reporting.
