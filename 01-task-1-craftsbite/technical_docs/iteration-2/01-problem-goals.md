## 2. Problem Statement

**Current State:**
The meal planning process relies on manual Excel spreadsheet tracking, which creates significant operational challenges:

- High administrative burden on logistics team (daily manual updates)
- Frequent errors in headcount leading to meal wastage or shortages
- No self-service capability for employees to manage preferences
- Lack of audit trail for participation changes
- Inefficient communication for exceptions (vacations, business trips)
- Time-consuming reconciliation between multiple data sources

**Impact:**

- Wasted logistics team time that could be spent on strategic activities
- Food wastage due to inaccurate headcounts
- Employee frustration with rigid opt-out process
- No accountability for last-minute changes
