## Review Notes

- Each file is **self-contained** and can be reviewed independently.
- Section numbering inside files reflects the original document for traceability.
- Changes should be made in the **most relevant file** rather than duplicating content.
- The appendix is reference-only and not required for first-pass review.

---

## Change Policy

- Structural changes to this documentation should preserve section numbering.
- Technical changes must be reflected in both:
  - Design sections
  - Relevant operational or security sections (if applicable)
